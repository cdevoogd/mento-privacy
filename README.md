# Mento Privacy Policy

Mento's purpose is to store and organize bookmarks. When you create a bookmark, that bookmark and its associated data will be stored on the server hosting the Mento API. That data will never be sold.

Mento uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) to help with authentcation. When you log in to Mento, you first log into the Supabase project, and the credentials are then used in requests to Mento's API. Mento stores the unique user ID as a part of your bookmarks, but does not store your email address or any other authentication information on the server.

Mento does not use any form of analytics or reporting. No data is collected about the use of the app.
